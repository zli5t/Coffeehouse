/* NEED TO WORK OUT SUB-POST HIEARACHY SYSTEM 
    AND METHOD OF PRIROTIZING SUB-POSTS TO A PERSON */
There are Discussions
    Discussions have a URL
    Discussions begin with a Topic
            which contains some text and an optional /heading/
    Discussions consist of Posts
        Posts can be Starred by an individual
            This brings up an option to alert PARTICULAR individuals to a post
        Posts can also be linked to

    Topics can be Tagged with Interests (tagging is autocompleted)
    Topics can belong to a Group


Groups consist of a set of people
Groups have small profile pages
A person can also see all posts that belong to a Group and easily post to a 
Group

A Person can Search for an Interest
    (This is equivalent to the Interest's "Page")
    The Person will be presented with a set of discussions weighted by what
    the system thinks the person would like, in particular:
        === The following list is referred to as Proximity ===
        The closeness on the social graph of the people in the discussion
            This is enchanced by closeness in Groups
        How much people close on the social graph have starred the discussion
        The intensity of the discussion
        The age of the discussion
        The levels of common interest in the people in the discussion    
        Physical Proximity
Likewise, a Person can search for any term, which will do a search not
just by Interest but by content in the posts
